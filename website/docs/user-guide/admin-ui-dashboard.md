# Admin UI Dashboard Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the ID PASS DataCollect Admin UI Dashboard. The dashboard is a web-based interface for managing application configurations, users, and monitoring data.

## 1. Logging In

To access the admin dashboard, you must first log in with your credentials.

1.  Navigate to the admin URL provided by your system administrator.
2.  Enter your **Username** (email) and **Password**.
3.  Click the **Login** button.

Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the main dashboard.

<!-- ![Login Screen]() -->

## 2. The Dashboard (App Manager)

The main page after logging in is the App Manager, which displays all available application configurations, often referred to as "Apps".

<!-- ![App Manager]() -->

### Features

-   **App List**: A grid of cards, where each card represents an application configuration.
-   **Upload Config**: You can create a new app configuration by uploading a valid JSON file using the "Upload JSON Config File" button.

### App Card

Each app is displayed on a card with the following details and actions:

-   **Name**: The display name of the configuration.
-   **ID**: The unique identifier for the configuration.
-   **Version**: The version number of the configuration.
-   **Entities**: The total number of data records (entities) collected for this configuration.
-   **QR Code**: A QR code that can be scanned by the mobile app to load the configuration.
-   **Menu (â‹®)**: A menu with several actions:
    -   **Download Config**: Downloads the complete configuration as a JSON file.
    -   **Sync**: Initiates an external synchronization process if configured.
    -   **Edit**: Opens the configuration editor for this app.
    -   **Copy**: Creates a new configuration by copying the existing one.
    -   **Delete**: Permanently deletes the app configuration and its associated data.

## 3. Creating and Editing Configurations

You can create a new configuration from scratch by clicking the **Create Config** button in the navigation bar, or edit an existing one via the App Card menu.

<!-- ![Config Editor]() -->

The configuration form is divided into several sections:

### Basic Information

-   **Name**: A unique name for your configuration.
-   **Description**: A brief description of the configuration's purpose.
-   **Version**: A version number to track changes.

### Entity Forms

This section allows you to define the data collection forms for your application.

-   Click **Add Entity Form** to create a new form.
-   **Name & Title**: Set a unique name (for internal use) and a display title for the form.
-   **Depends On**: Create hierarchical relationships by making a form dependent on another (e.g., a "member" form that depends on a "household" form). The system prevents circular dependencies.
-   **Build/Edit Form**: Click this button to open the **Form Builder**.

#### Form Builder

The Form Builder is a powerful visual tool based on Form.io for creating your data collection forms. You can drag and drop various components (text fields, number inputs, dropdowns, etc.), set validation rules, and define the form's layout. When you save the form in the builder, its JSON schema is saved into your main application configuration.

-   **Type**: Select the type of external system (e.g., OpenSPP, OpenFn).
-   **URL**: The endpoint URL of the external system.

-   **Create Config**: The configuration editor.

To log out, click the user account icon on the far right of the navigation bar and select **Logout**.
